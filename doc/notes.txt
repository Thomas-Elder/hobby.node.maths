# API Planning

To start let's decide on a minimal API, a set of functions we want to support.

We could roll these into a sub-module, arithmetic;
* sum
* subtract
* multiply
* divide

Then the next step (might be 2.0 given it'll change the API) could be a statistics sub-module with things like;
* mean
* median
* standard deviation
* min
* max
etc.

Ok so as of version 1.0.2, we have a reasonably functional arithmetic module. I'm going to try publish it, then use it in an unrelated app. 

v1.0.7 is on NPM, and I managed to install and use it from a separate project.

I think I've been using the versioning incorrectly, in that I kind of used it for every commit. It should really only be for every release. 

So I published version 1.1.0, including the statistics module. 

Further ideas include sorting algorithms, and trying to implement some more math functions like sqrt. Might leave it for now though. I think I've sort of ticked the goal of this project.
