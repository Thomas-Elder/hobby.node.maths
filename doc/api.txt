# API Planning

To start let's decide on a minimal API, a set of functions we want to support.

We could roll these into a sub-module, arithmetic;
* sum
* subtract
* multiply
* divide

Then the next step (might be 2.0 given it'll change the API) could be a statistics sub-module with things like;
* mean
* median
* standard deviation
* min
* max
etc.

Ok so as of version 1.0.2, we have a reasonably functional arithmetic module. I'm going to try publish it, then use it in an unrelated app.
