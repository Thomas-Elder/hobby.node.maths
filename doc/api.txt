# API Planning

To start let's decide on a minimal API, a set of functions we want to support.

We could roll these into a sub-module, arithmetic;
* sum
* subtract
* multiply
* divide

Then the next step (might be 2.0 given it'll change the API) could be a statistics sub-module with things like;
* mean
* median
* standard deviation
* min
* max
etc.
